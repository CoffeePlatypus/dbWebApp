1,Horse,"These can most often be found on plains. Their usefulness as transportation has made them valuable since ancient times. That said, wild horses do tend to get spooked and run off when approached, so if you're looking to snag one, it's best to sneak up on it."
2,Giant Horse,"This giant horse is the last of its kind. Its physical capabilities completely overshadow those of regular horses, but its temperament is extremely wild. Only a truly skilled rider can train, or even catch, this beast of a mount. This is a horse that chooses its rider."
3,White Horse,The Hyrulean royal family that perished 100 years ago would sometimes ride atop white horses as a display of their divine right. This white horse may be a descendant of one once ridden by royalty.
4,Lord of the Mountain,"This noble creature watches over all animals that make their homes in the forest. Legends say this holy creature is a reincarnation of a sage that died on the lands it now protects. It has an acute awareness of its surroundings, so it seldom appears before people.

5,Stalhorse,"This skeletal horse is ridden by monsters. It was once a regular horse, but Ganon's power revived it from death. It cannot maintain its bone structure in the daytime."

They rely on their excellent hearing to find their way while riding submerged in the sand.Their large, distinct tusks look pretty ferocious, but their favorite food is actually fruit."
8,Patricia,"This is Riju's own sand seal. It may look intense, but she dotes on it regularly; the ribbon it wears was a gift form her, and it even has its own pen in Gerudo Town. It's far more agile than any other sand seal and far more outgoing. An ever-reliable partner to Riju, Patricia is always ready to take off through the desert at a moment's notice."

17,Hateno Cow,"These cows are kept as livestock primarily for their milk. Their horns are smaller than a water buffalo's, and they're much more docile and therefore easier to raise. Their horns are decorated with bright colors when taken out to pasture."

They're most fond of nuts and grain but won't pass up the occasional insect or earthworm if offered. Their meat is of a higher quality than typical wood pigeon's.
